#Assignment 4 - Components

##Description

This is a small library of components that can later be re-used.
It includes my own specified components, when a user clicks on the name of a component in the nav-bar list that component is rendered while also removing all other components from the page, so that only one component is visible at a time

##Source - codes
The function for makeing an image slider has been taken from this url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HcxHDS2w1s&t=724s.
This is also commented on in the JS file

##license
